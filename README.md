# kickass-api-wrapper

### Description ###

This program allows you to set up a [KickassTorrents](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/KickassTorrents) (a.k.a. KAT) RSS API wrapper to be used with services like [SickBeard](http://sickbeard.com), [SickRage](https://sickrage.github.io) or [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv).

By using this program, it is possible to retrieve data from raw HTML pages served by KAT clones, hence provide results as RSS feeds to be used by different software programs.
